# NFCHealthMonitoring

A NFC based mobile healthcare device is designed to reduce the complexity and mistakes in the diagnosis by the doctors. This is done by NFC enabled device. There will be many patients in a hospital and it’s very difficult to maintain the records in paper and there are also chances of patients losing their prescriptions and test results or it can also be misplaced in the hospitals. During emergency condition doctors need not to start the tests from the scratch. Hence to avoid these problems, we have proposed NFC enabled mobile devices which can be used to keep the track of patients’ identification and can also retrieve the previous records. The proposed method can be developed into advanced healthcare system by introducing the concept of artificial intelligence wherein we can predict the right medication and treatment.
